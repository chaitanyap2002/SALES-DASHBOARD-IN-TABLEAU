# SALES-DASHBOARD-IN-TABLEAU
I have created an interactive dashboard in Tableau that shows sales according to state, category, and subcategory. Various visuals have been used in the dashboard, including KPI cards, donut charts, area charts, bar charts, and pie charts.

I imported the Excel sheet 'Sample Superstore' and extracted useful insights from it which show sales month-wise. The dashboard is interactive and has a year filter. I also used filters that make the entire dashboard easy to navigate and draw conclusions from.
